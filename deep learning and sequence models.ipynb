    "##deep neural network brief:\n",
    " this is the learning that copyies how the brain functions.\n",
    "It is a subset of machine learning and is called deep learning\n",
    "because it makes use of deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "for all algorithms it has:\n",
    "-input layer\n",
    "-hidden layer\n",
    "-output layer\n",
    "the inptu layer accepts many inputs of data and operates in   multiple \n",
    "layers to produce the  desired output.\n",
    "thus the following  steps are used in the deep learniig process\n",
    ":\n",
    "1.understand the problem\n",
    "2.identify the data\n",
    "3.select the deep learning algorigthm\n",
    "4.train the model \n",
    "5.test the model\n",
    " \n",
    "The learning occurs in two phases.\n",
    "1.The first phase consists of applying a nonlinear transformation of the \n",
    "input and create a statistical model as output.\n",
    "2.The second phase aims at improving the model with a mathematical method \n",
    "known as derivative.\n",
    "thus the neural network repeats these two phases via itaretion 100 to 1000 times \n",
    "till when the accurate output is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "classification of neural network \n",
    "-shallow neural network(has on hidden layer between the input and output layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "-deep neural network(has more than one hidden layer between the input and \n",
    "output layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of deep neural newtork are:\n",
    "1.Feed-forward neural network\n",
    "   -its the simplest and has the flow in one direction,meaning the flow stars at the \n",
    "   input then to the hidden layer the to the outputlayer,this means there is no\n",
    "   loop in this neural network thus the flow of info stops at the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Recurrent neural network\n",
    "   -its a multilayer that its data flow in sequences thus it involves loops.\n",
    "Common uses of RNN\n",
    "-Help securities traders to generate analytic reports\n",
    "-Detect abnormalities in the contract of financial statement\n",
    "-Detect fraudulent credit-card transaction\n",
    "-Provide a caption for images\n",
    "-Power chatbots\n",
    "-The standard uses of RNN occur when the practitioners are working with \n",
    "time-series data or sequences (e.g., audio recordings or text).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Convolution neural network \n",
    "   -its used for more complex features mostly used for unstructed dataset \n",
    "and the practitioner need to extract information from it.\n",
    "consider the following example:\n",
    "For instance, if the task is to predict an image caption:\n",
    "1.The CNN receives an image of let's say a cat, this image, in computer term, \n",
    " is a collection of the pixel. Generally, one layer for the greyscale picture \n",
    " and three layers for a color picture.\n",
    "2.During the feature learning (i.e., hidden layers), the network will identify \n",
    "  unique features, for instance, the tail of the cat, the ear, etc.\n",
    "3.When the network thoroughly learned how to recognize a picture, it can provide\n",
    "  a probability for each image it knows. The label with the highest probability \n",
    "  will become the prediction of the network. \n",
    "\n",
    " THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\n",
    "this is the subfield in machine learning that the system is trained to receive \n",
    "rewards or punishment be learning from trail and error.\n",
    "this is used even in video games to improve the gaming experience to provide the\n",
    "smarter bot.\n",
    "some algorithms used are:\n",
    "1.Q-learning\n",
    "2.Deep Qnetwork \n",
    "3.State Action-reward-state-action\n",
    "4.Deep deterministic policy gradient \n",
    "\n",
    "some applications of deep learning are in finance,HR,and even marketing\n",
    "\n",
    "deep learning is important because it\n",
    " -help to predict the actionable results,\n",
    " -it predicts the most accurate value even for unsupervised data.\n",
    "some limitations of deep learning are\n",
    " -hard in data labeling\n",
    " -obtain huge triaining  datasets so as to give an accurate output.\n",
    " -can't explain a problem like a human being \n",
    " \n",
    "below\n",
    "There are various sequence models in the deep learning domain,letâ€™s see\n",
    " the applications we can apply these models to.\n",
    "1.Speech recognition: \n",
    "     Input: audio clip -> Output: text\n",
    "2.Music generation:\n",
    "    Input: integer referring to genre (or an empty set) -> Output: music\n",
    "3.Sentiment classification: \n",
    "      Input: text -> Output: ratings\n",
    "4.DNA sequence analysis: \n",
    "     Input: DNA (alphabet) -> Output: label part of the DNA sequence\n",

    "    Input: sentence -> Output: identify people within it."
